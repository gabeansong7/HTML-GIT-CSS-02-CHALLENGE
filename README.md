# HTML-GIT-CSS-02-CHALLENGE

In this assignment, HTML and CSS were used to create a webpage. My challenge was to go through and refactor the code inside the HTML and CSS folders. In the HTML folder, I added a couple of classes in order to simplify the CSS implication of it.

For example, I added "catagories" inside the classes of "search-engine-optimization", "online-reputation-management", and "social-media-marketing" in order to use ".catagories" in CSS to class the three of them together since they had the same settings in CSS.

Doing this cut down on the amount of repitition in the CSS folder which in turn makes it easier to read.
